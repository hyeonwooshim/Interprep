# interprep

Interprep is a web application that allows users to copy and paste Bible verses with a specific format fit for JBCH Wednesday sermons. This application copies bible verses in English (New King James Version) and Korean (개역한글) to aid translators/interpreters who are translating a prerecorded Korean sermon to accurately convey the verses recited or read by the pastor.

## Format of Recited Verses
(depending on whether the pastor mentions the location of the verse before reciting or after)

        (책이름 장#:절#-절#) 구절
		(BookName Ch#:Vs#-Vs#) Verse Content

Or

        구절 (책이름 장#:절#-절#)
		Verse Content (BookName Ch#:Vs#-Vs#)

## Format of Read Verses (Verses found and read together)

        "책이름 장#:절#-절#"	"BookName Ch#:Vs#-Vs#"
		+---------------------------------------+
		|					|					|
        |      구절          |   Verse Content   |
